# Codebase Review Report - GStreamer MCP Server

## Executive Summary
The GStreamer MCP server project is in initial setup phase with comprehensive planning completed but zero implementation. Five detailed PRPs have been created covering all aspects of the system, but the codebase consists only of a minimal Rust project skeleton with "Hello, world!" as the only code.

**Primary recommendation**: Execute PRP-01 immediately to establish the foundational MCP server infrastructure and basic GStreamer integration, as all other features depend on this core functionality.

## Implementation Status

### Working
- **Planning Documentation**: 5 comprehensive PRPs created - Evidence: Complete PRP documents for all features

### Broken/Incomplete
- **Project Setup**: Cargo.toml lacks all required dependencies - Issue: Only has package metadata, no dependencies listed
- **MCP Server**: No server implementation exists - Issue: main.rs only contains "Hello, world!"

### Missing
- **All Core Components**: No implementation code exists - Impact: Project is non-functional
  - No MCP server infrastructure
  - No GStreamer integration
  - No handler modules
  - No tool implementations
  - No tests
  - No README documentation

## Code Quality

- **Test Results**: 0/0 tests (N/A - no tests exist)
- **TODO Count**: 0 occurrences in code (project not started)
- **Examples**: 0/0 working (none exist)
- **Code Files**: 1 file (main.rs with 3 lines)
- **Dependencies**: 0 configured (empty dependencies section)

## PRP Status Review

### PRP Analysis
1. **PRP-01: Basic MCP Server & Element Discovery** 
   - Status: ❌ Not implemented
   - Defines core server setup and 4 discovery tools
   
2. **PRP-02: Pipeline Launch and Control**
   - Status: ❌ Not implemented  
   - Depends on PRP-01 completion
   - Defines 6 pipeline management tools
   
3. **PRP-03: Element Suggestions and Similarity**
   - Status: ❌ Not implemented
   - Depends on PRP-01 completion
   - Defines 5 suggestion/search tools
   
4. **PRP-04: GStreamer-rs Programming Assistant**
   - Status: ❌ Not implemented
   - Defines 6 code generation tools
   
5. **PRP-05: Plugin Development Assistant**
   - Status: ❌ Not implemented
   - Defines 6 plugin development tools

Total Tools Planned: 27 MCP tools across 5 PRPs

## Recommendation

### Next Action: Execute PRP-01 (Basic MCP Server Setup & Element Discovery)

**Justification:**
- **Current capability**: Planning complete, but zero functional code
- **Gap**: No MCP server infrastructure exists to build upon
- **Impact**: Establishes foundation for all 27 planned tools and enables basic GStreamer interaction

### Implementation Steps for PRP-01:
1. Update Cargo.toml with dependencies (rmcp, gstreamer, tokio, etc.)
2. Create module structure (lib.rs, handler.rs, discovery.rs, error.rs)
3. Implement basic MCP server with stdio transport
4. Add GStreamer initialization
5. Implement 4 discovery tools (ListGstElements, InspectGstElement, ListGstPlugins, SearchGstElements)

## 90-Day Roadmap

### Week 1-2: Core Infrastructure
**Action**: Execute PRP-01 basic implementation
**Outcome**: Working MCP server with element discovery tools

### Week 3-4: Pipeline Management  
**Action**: Execute PRP-02 for pipeline control
**Outcome**: Ability to launch and control GStreamer pipelines via MCP

### Week 5-8: Intelligence Layer
**Action**: Execute PRP-03 for suggestions and PRP-04 for code generation
**Outcome**: Smart element recommendations and Rust code generation

### Week 9-12: Polish & Extensions
**Action**: Execute PRP-05, add tests, documentation, and examples
**Outcome**: Complete feature set with plugin development assistance

## Technical Debt Priorities

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Critical impact - Zero effort (update Cargo.toml)
2. **No README**: High impact - Low effort (document setup and usage)
3. **No Tests**: Medium impact - Medium effort (add as features are implemented)
4. **No CI/CD**: Low impact - Low effort (can add GitHub Actions later)

## Architectural Decisions to Make

1. **Error Handling Strategy**: Use thiserror vs anyhow
2. **Async Runtime**: Confirm tokio usage
3. **Logging**: Setup tracing vs env_logger
4. **Configuration**: File-based vs environment variables
5. **Testing Strategy**: Unit vs integration test balance

## Success Metrics

- [ ] MCP server responds to initialization
- [ ] Can list GStreamer elements  
- [ ] Can inspect element properties
- [ ] Can launch basic pipelines
- [ ] All 27 planned tools implemented
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Test coverage >70%

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Today**: Update Cargo.toml with PRP-01 dependencies
2. **Tomorrow**: Create module structure and basic MCP server
3. **This Week**: Complete PRP-01 implementation with all 4 discovery tools
4. **Next Week**: Begin PRP-02 pipeline management
